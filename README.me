The makefile has the following commands:

    make (compiles all relevant files into objects and executables)
    make clean (cleans out all object and executable files)
    make run (this can be ignored as the shell script can be used for testing purposes)

I modified the shell script to work with extractor.exe instead of just 'extractor'.
The same was done for ffmpeg (changed to ffmpeg.exe).

Program has limited functionality right now.
